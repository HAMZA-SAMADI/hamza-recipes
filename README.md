# hamza Recipes

This is a simple HTML project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## 🧑‍🍳 What the Project Includes

- A main index page linking to several recipe pages
- Basic use of headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- Structuring HTML files in a clean and semantic way

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Using semantic HTML tags properly
- Working with relative paths for images and links
- Organizing content using lists and structure

## 💡 Reflection

Through this project, I’m getting more confident with writing HTML from scratch and structuring web pages.  
It’s a great first step toward becoming a front-end web developer.
