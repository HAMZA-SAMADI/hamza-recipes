      <h2>Description</h2>
       <H3>Butter Chicken — The Creamy King of Curries</H3>
        <p>Butter Chicken, or "Murgh Makhani," is India’s answer
        to cozy, luxurious dining. This beloved curry brings
        together succulent pieces of chicken marinated in
        yogurt and spices, then cooked until lightly charred
        for a smoky depth. The chicken is then simmered in
        a velvety sauce made of tomatoes, cream, butter,
        and warming spices like garam masala, cumin, and
        coriander. The result is a beautiful balance
        between savory and slightly sweet, mild heat
        and rich creaminess. Each bite is bold yet
        smooth, deeply spiced but never overwhelming.
        Served with basmati rice or fluffy naan, Butter
        Chicken is the kind of dish that turns any dinner
        into a special occasion — indulgent, aromatic,
        and unforgettable.</p>
